# Dwn Ui

This project is the frontend for DWN.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Make sure you let the backend know that there is a UI proxy so that it tells the correct redirect url to the OpenID provider.

## Build

Run `ng build --no-aot` to build the project for prod because I need to stop it from tree shaking the shopping list.
